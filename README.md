# REACT Cookbook
This is quick little app created using modern REACT (functions and hooks). This app lets you create recipes and store them to a small API I created.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, JSX

The front-end is fully built using React and I used plain CSS to add some additional styling points. The app lets you add and delete recipes and view details about the recipes. I also used the react-dom and react-icon libraries in this project.

## Optimizations

I made this app quickly but if I had more time I'd build out the back and have users create profiles where they can store their personalized recipes to their accounts. This would allow more customization but will also prevent users from deleting recipes others put in. 

## Lessons Learned:

I practiced using REACT hooks more instead of their old class system. This method seems to be a lot easier and quicker to add components so I really enjoyed using this method of React.
